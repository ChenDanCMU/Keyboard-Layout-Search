    "# A Combinatorial Optimization Approach to Keyboard Layout Design\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "[QWERTY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY) has been by far the most popular keyboard layout in the world. However, it was not optimized for typing English. Several key placements are clearly suboptimal. For example, \"j\" is placed in the home position of right index finger, one of the most comfortable positions, yet \"j\" is the least used key in English texts. \n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of alternative keyboard layouts have been designed in the past 150 years since [QWERTY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY) was created. The most popular ones are [Drovak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout) and [Colemak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colemak). Many of those alternative layouts are designed for a more comfortable English typing experience. However, they were mostly designed manually and there were very few quantitative or automatic approaches to this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this note, we provide a combinatorial algorithm for designing keyboard layouts optimized for English texts. We collect real text frequency data using publicly available books from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/), and optimized a quantitative objective with the following two goals in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) The more frequently used keys should be closer to the home positions and pressed using stronger fingers.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Alternating the fingers as much as possible (i.e. avoid typing two consecutive keys using the same finger).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notations and Preliminaries\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume the keyboard has $n$ keys, indexed by $\\{0, 1, ..., n-1\\}$. An alphabet $\\alpha$ of $n$ keys are required to be placed on the keyboard. For our purpose, we are interested in a setting where $n=31$: the keyboard is in a 10x3 matrix format, with an additional space key that is fixed, and the alphabet is $\\alpha$ = \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz,./' \". Denote the text by a string $s$ with length $L$, which may contain characters from $\\alpha$. For simplicity, we assume the first character and the last character of $s$ are both space characters. \n",
    "\n",
    "A keyboard layout $\\pi$ is a permutation from $\\{0, 1, ..., n-1\\}$ to $\\{0, 1, ..., n-1\\}$.  $\\pi(i) = j$ means that the character $\\alpha[i] $ is assigned to the $j$-th key on the keyboard. Our goal is to find a keyboard layout $\\pi$ that types the text $s$ most easily, based on certain quantitative criteria."

    "## Effort Model\n",
    "\n",
    "We introduce a simple model for quantifying the difficulty of typing a given text. This model was inspired by (and simplified from) the analysis in [Colemak-DH](https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/compare.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Define the total effort for typing $s$ by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\text{TotalEffort}(\\pi, s) = \\frac{1}{m_1}\\sum_{i=0}^{L-1} \\text{BaseEffort}(\\pi(s[i])) +\\frac{1}{m_2}\\sum_{i=0}^{L-2} \\text{Penalty}(\\pi(s[i]), \\pi(s[i+1])). $\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $m_1$ is the number of characters that is not a space key, and $m_2$ is the number of bigrams $(s[i], s[i+1])$ such that neither of them is a space key.\n",
    "\n",
    "This effort model has two components: BaseEffort and Penalty. From a high level, BaseEffort encourages the more frequently used keys to be closer to the home positions / pressed using stronger fingers; Penalty discourages pressing two consecutive keys using the same finger.\n",
    "\n",
    "The definitions of these two components are both slight variants from [Colemak-DH](https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/compare.html). However, [Colemak-DH](https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/compare.html) did not provide any algorithmic way to optimize their objective. To our best knowledge, all of the attempts to improve Colemak on the Colemak forum, has been done manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Base Effort Grid\n",
    "This is a measurement of the difficulty to press each key on the keyboard. See [Here](https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/model.html) for details. For mathematical convenience, we also introduce an extra \"space\" key which has zero effort to press.\n",
    "\n",
    "![The base effort matrix](kbmatrix.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Same Finger Bigram Penalty\n",
    "Recall that Penalty discourages pressing two consecutive keys using the same finger. We let $\\text{Penalty}(i, j) >0$ if and only if the $i$-th and $j$-th keys are pressed using the same finger. The \"space\" key is not counted towards the penalty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, when $i$ and $j$ are pressed using the same finger, $\\text{Penalty}(i, j)= 2.5$ if they are on the same row, $\\text{Penalty}(i, j)= 3$ if they are one row apart from each other, and $\\text{Penalty}(i, j)= 4$ if they are two rows apart from each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "We note that the scoring values chosen in Penalty and BaseEffort are highly subjective, as noted by the author of [Colemak-DH](https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/compare.html). We decided to use their scoring values as is, for two reasons: (1) designing the scoring system is not the focus of this project; (2) the author has put some quite significant effort to design the system, which has also been accepted by the Colemak users community. Our algorithmic approach generalizes to other choice of the scoring system in a straightforward manner."

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "From the above comparison, we can see that our algorithmically generated layouts scores better than almost all of the manually designed layouts. We can see that in our score model, colemak-dh is a very well-designed layout (perhaps not so surprising because the scoring model we used was, for the most part, designed by the author of colemak-dh). It's only marginally worse than the algorithmically generated layout ours-qwazxc, and better than ours-qwazxcv (which has one extra constraint on the placement of 'v'). We also note that ours-qwazxc layout is extremely similar to colemak-dh: they are only different on 6 key assignments, mostly infrequently used ones. All layouts improved over QWERTY by a very big margin."
